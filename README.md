# flac_gui
A GUI to process music files into FLAC

I wrote this software to compress my music collection to the maximum by using the FLAC `-8` level. It also includes the -e (Exhaustive model search) and -p (Exhaustively search LP coeff quantization) flags to further compress the files.

The software looks like this:

You need to copy `flac.exe` to the location where you have this software.

Written in Visual Basic .NET using Visual Studio 2017.

Enjoy!
